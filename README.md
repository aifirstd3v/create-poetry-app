## Command-Line Options

The script accepts the following command-line options:

- `-y` : Use default values for all prompts.
- `-p` : Set the project name.
- `-n` : Set the package name.
- `-v` : Set the Python version (supports semver specifiers like `^3.12` or `~3.12`).
- `-u` : Set an optional upper Python version limit.
- `-d` : Set the project description.
- `-a` : Set the author name.
- `-e` : Set the author email.
- `-c` : Set the virtual environment configuration (`true` or `false`).

### Examples

#### Example 1: Using Defaults

To create a new project using default values for all prompts:

```sh
create-poetry-app -y
```

#### Example 2: Specifying Project Name and Python Version

To create a new project with a specified name and Python version:

```sh
create-poetry-app -p my_project -v "^3.12"
```

#### Example 3: Full Customization

To create a new project with full customization:

```sh
create-poetry-app -p my_project -n my_package -v "^3.12" -u "3.33" -d "My new project" -a "Smith Neo" -e "aifirstd3v@matrix.universe" -c true
```

### Prompted Input

If any required options are not provided via the command line, the script will prompt for them interactively. For example, running the script without the `-v` option will prompt for the Python version.

#### Example Workflow

Here is an example workflow when running the script with no options:

1. The script will prompt for the project name:
   ```
   Enter project name:
   ```
   The user inputs:
   ```
   matrixworld
   ```

2. The script will prompt for the internal project name (default: `main`):
   ```
   Enter your package name (default: main):
   ```
   The user inputs:
   ```
   singularity
   ```

3. The script will prompt for the Python version (default: `3.12`):
   ```
   Enter Python version (default: ^3.12, e.g., 3.12 or ^3.12 or ~3.12). If you plan to add an upper version limit, enter numbers only:
   ```
   The user inputs:
   ```
   3.11
   ```

4. The script will prompt for the upper Python version limit (default: `3.12`):
   ```
   Enter upper Python version limit (optional, numbers only, e.g., 3.33):
   ```
   The user inputs:
   ```
   3.13
   ```

5. The script will prompt for the project description (default: `""`):
   ```
   Enter project description (default: ):
   ```
   The user inputs:
   ```
   My Project Matrix Multiverse
   ```

6. The script will prompt for the author name (default: `Your Name`):
   ```
   Enter author name (default: Your Name):
   ```
   The user inputs:
   ```
   Smith Neo
   ```

7. The script will prompt for the author email (default: `you@example.com`):
   ```
   Enter author email (default: you@example.com):
   ```
   The user inputs:
   ```
   aifirstd3v@matrix.universe
   ```

8. The script will prompt for the virtual environment configuration (default: `true`):
   ```
   Set virtualenvs.in-project to true/false (default: true):
   ```
   The user inputs:
   ```
   true
   ```

9. The script will then create the project with the specified details, set up the virtual environment, and activate it:
   ```
   Project 'myproject' created and virtual environment activated with Python 3.11
   ```

This workflow demonstrates the interactive mode where the user is prompted for each piece of information if not provided via command line options.

## Adding create-poetry-app to Your Shell Configuration

To make the `create-poetry-app` script easily accessible from anywhere in your terminal, you can add it to your shell configuration file. This will allow you to run the script from any directory without needing to specify the full path.

#### For macOS and Linux Users:

1. **Move the Script to a Directory in Your PATH**:

   It's common to move scripts to `/usr/local/bin` so they are in your system's PATH. However, depending on your system configuration, you might use a different directory such as `/usr/bin` or another location included in your PATH. You can find out the directories in your PATH by running `echo $PATH` in your terminal.

   Here is a command to move the script to `/usr/local/bin` and make it executable:

   ```sh
   sudo mv create-poetry-app /usr/local/bin/
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/create-poetry-app
   ```

   If you prefer to use a different directory, replace `/usr/local/bin/` with your preferred directory.

2. **Add to Shell Configuration File**:

   Depending on your shell, you need to add the directory to your PATH in your shell configuration file. The common files are:

   - **Bash**: `~/.bashrc`
   - **Zsh**: `~/.zshrc`

   (You can modify the configuration file according to your system's environment.)

   If you're not sure which shell you are using, you can check by running `echo $SHELL` in your terminal.

   - For **Bash** users, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

     ```sh
     echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

   - For **Zsh** users, add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

     ```sh
     echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

3. **Reload Your Shell Configuration**:

   After editing the configuration file, you need to reload it to apply the changes:

   - For **Bash** users:

     ```sh
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

   - For **Zsh** users:

     ```sh
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

4. **Run the Script from Anywhere**:

   Now you can run the `create-poetry-app` script from any directory by simply typing:

   ```sh
   create-poetry-app
   ```

By following these steps, you'll make `create-poetry-app` easily accessible, streamlining your workflow and allowing you to set up new Poetry projects quickly and efficiently from anywhere in your terminal.

### Important Poetry Configuration Settings

To maximize the efficiency and usability of Poetry, here are some key configuration settings and additional knowledge you should be aware of:

| Configuration                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `virtualenvs.in-project`         | Determines whether to create virtual environments within the project directory. Set to `true` to keep the virtual environment in the project folder. |
| `virtualenvs.path`               | Defines the path where virtual environments will be created. By default, this is in a cache directory under your home directory.                   |
| `virtualenvs.prefer-active-python` | If set to `true`, uses the currently active Python version to create new virtual environments. Introduced in Poetry 1.2.0.                               |
| `virtualenvs.prompt`             | Sets the format for the virtual environment prompt. Variables available for formatting include `{project_name}` and `{python_version}`.               |

### Setting Configuration Options

You can set these configuration options using the `poetry config` command. Here are some examples:

- **Set virtual environments to be created within the project directory**:
  ```sh
  poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
  ```

- **Set the path for virtual environments**:
  ```sh
  poetry config virtualenvs.path "/path/to/your/virtualenvs"
  ```

- **Use the currently active Python version for new virtual environments**:
  ```sh
  poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true
  ```

- **Customize the virtual environment prompt**:
  ```sh
  poetry config virtualenvs.prompt "{project_name}-py{python_version}"
  ```

### Additional Tips

- **Environment Variables**: Poetry can be configured using environment variables, which can be particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines or when you need temporary settings.
- **Lock Files**: The `poetry.lock` file is crucial for ensuring consistent environments across different setups. Always commit this file to your version control system.
- **Dependency Groups**: Poetry allows you to manage dependencies in groups (e.g., `dev`, `test`). This helps keep your production environment clean and your development environment fully equipped.

By mastering these commands and configuration settings, you can take full advantage of Poetry's powerful features and streamline your Python project management.
